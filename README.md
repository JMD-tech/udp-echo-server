# udp-echo-server
An implementation of udp-based echo server and client

# How To run:
# First you need to compile client.cpp and server.cpp, and run the server:
  1. Open a terminal in a Linux-based OS.
  2. Compile both files using the command: make
  3. Now run the server using the command: ./server 8000

# Now you need to compile and run client.cpp
  4. Open another terminal in linux OS.
  5. Now run the client using the command: ./client 127.0.0.1 8000

# Some Clarifications:
1. In step 2, the argument 8000 is the port number on which the server will listen. You can pass any valid port number on which you want the server to listen. The server binds to all available ip addresses (INADDR_ANY).

2. The command in step 6 has two command line arguments. The first argument (127.0.0.1) is the ip address of the server. If the server is on another machine, then you can pass the ip address of that machine. The second argument is the port number on which the server is listening.

3. The client will take input from the user and send it to the server. The server will send the input back to the client.

4. When the user passes "exit" as input, the client will terminate.

5. To terminate the server, enter any key and press enter.
